# Brainfuck But With Buffer

This is a little EsoLang I made.

It's strongly inspired by brainfuck, but I've added a buffer.
- You can add and subtract only from the buffer.
- You can then "write" the buffer value to the selected cell, overwriting any existing value.
- You can "read" from the selected cell, this action will overwrite the buffer.
- You can clear the buffer

I've also implemented separated I/O commands for ASCII and integers
